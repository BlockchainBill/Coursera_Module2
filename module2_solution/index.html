                        A Thai dish of stir-fried rice noodles with eggs, vegetables and tofu 
                        in a sauce of tamarind, garlic, red chilli pepper and sugar. 
                        Some of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments,
                         including red chilli pepper, lime wedges and peanuts.

                    <p id=text2 class=boxtext>
                        A hot sandwich (toastie) made with one or more varieties of cheese 
                        on bread. It is typically prepared by heating one or more slices of 
                        cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on 
                        a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and 
                        the cheese melts. A grilled cheese may contain ingredients besides 
                        the bread and cheese, as long as the latter is the main focus.

                        A sandwich that consists of peanut butter and fruit preserves 
                        spread on bread. The sandwich may be open-faced, made of a single 
                        slice of bread folded over, or made between two slices of bread.
